# BuyKar
Actually The name is inspired by both bikes and cars, 

which you can purchase on our website. It starts with "B" for bike, has "k" in the middle also for bike, and ends with "ar" for car, making the pronunciation "Bikecar". 

This visually indicates the word "buy". 
So, the combination of these elements results in "Buykar".
